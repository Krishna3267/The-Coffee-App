# Brew Crew ☕

My first Flutter project, infact the first time I made a mobile application.
So I made this project while learning Dart, Flutter & Firebase along with The Net Ninja and say what! I reached till the end with that satisfaction along with a sigh for the end of a great great experience. I mean, I enjoyed these tutorials so much and I was so excited as this was my first hand at <i>App development</i> 🌱. 

I started with learning <i>Dart</i> 🎯, which I loved for it was much similar to the languages I already knew + It has amazing debugging environment and great great feature 💙.
Then I started <i>flutter</i> 🪶 somehow, it resembled to me as <i>React.js</i>. It, ofcourse, is an excellent framework with a great documentation, which proved to be a huge learning source for me 💯. Tho, the fact that sometimes, you continuosly have to pass props to wids and wids to props is a bit tiring stuf. Still I believe it shall be seen upon by the cooks someday 🧑‍🍳.

For once, I can say that Flutter and dart is to apps what React and JS is to Webs 😯

Further, I learned to integrated <i>Firebase Authentication</i> as well as <i>Firestore</i> for storing and update/delete data in my Flutter app and Realized the greatness of <b>Flutter + Firebase Combo</b> 🔥. Firebase is ❤️

I used the below listed packages from <a href="https://pub.dev/"><i>pub.dev</i></a> which is the official package repository for Dart and Flutter apps 🚴:
1. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore">cloud_firestore</a> (version ^3.1.8) 
A Flutter plugin to use the Cloud Firestore API.
2. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core">firebase_core</a> (version 1.10.6) 
A Flutter plugin to use the Firebase Core API, which enables connecting to multiple Firebase apps.
I had a lot of version issues with this one, which forced me to use an older one. 
3. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">provider</a> (version ^6.0.2)
This is an amazing thing (crazier to use it) and it's a <b>google recommended solution for state management in flutter.</b>
4. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit">flutter_spinkit</a> (version ^5.1.0)
It provides you cute sweet flutter animated Loaders for your app and is pretty simple to use too.

Ya! So that was it 🟡. 

Before a good bye I'd like to mention that 🌃 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC">this</a> is where I learnt this from. Can't Thank much to Net Ninja(and stackoverflow🙇).

A very USEFUL thing for you, me, us and all 🙂:
<a href="https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration/">Firebase Migration Guide</a> as the name says, it lets you know what has changed with the new version.

Baki toh sab samajhdar hi hai 🙏. Ye toh bas feelings express karneka man hua toh itna sab likh diya.

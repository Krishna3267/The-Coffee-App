# The Coffee App â˜•

My first Flutter projectðŸŒ± <br>
Made it while learning Dart, Flutter & Firebase along with The Net Ninja. <br>
Recognized the greatness of <b>Flutter + Firebase Combo</b> ðŸ”¥

Used the below listed packages from <a href="https://pub.dev/"><i>pub.dev</i></a>, the official package repository for Dart and Flutter apps ðŸš´:
1. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore">cloud_firestore</a> (version ^3.1.8) 
A Flutter plugin to use the Cloud Firestore API.
2. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core">firebase_core</a> (version 1.10.6) 
A Flutter plugin to use the Firebase Core API, which enables connecting to multiple Firebase apps.
had a lot of version issues with this oneðŸ˜« 
3. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">provider</a> (version ^6.0.2)
This is an amazing thing and it's a <b>google recommended solution for state management in flutter.</b>
4. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit">flutter_spinkit</a> (version ^5.1.0)
It provides you cute sweet flutter animated Loaders for your app and is pretty simple to use too.

A very USEFUL thingðŸ™‚: <br>
<a href="https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration/">Firebase Migration Guide</a> lets you know what n what has changed with the new version.
